= Building Databases from Real-World Sources

== Problems

* Cleaning data is usually the most difficult part of setting up a database
* The human element makes this particularly difficult
* Multiple files
* Inconsistent format
* Typos

== Manual Entry

* Manual entry is an option but may result in errors within the DB
* A database will enforce stricter formatting, but that doesn't catch all errors

== Command Line Tools

* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/[sed]
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/[awk]
* https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-use-grep-command-in-linux-unix/[grep]
* head/tail/cut/sort/uniq

== Python

* Tons of useful libraries
* Can be interactive or standalone
* Can connect directly to the DB or generate files for import
* Python datastructures can represent complex relationships

=== csv

* default library for easily writing/reading CSV files
* https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html[good documentation]
* lots of options

=== Excel

* libraries exist for xls and https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[xlxs] files
* can access basic data from spreadsheets

=== pprint

* Pretty Printer
* good for showing complex Python datastructures
* less painful when checking results

=== re

* Built-in regular expression library
* https://regexone.com/[Learning regex can be very useful for scraping data]
* Can't solve everything, but can make your life easier

== Tips

* Watch out for inconsistencies before importing
* Check and double-check
* Test random entries in large datasets
* Watch out for capitalization
* Not all the data may be there!
* Build Python datastructures _then_ generate DB rows
