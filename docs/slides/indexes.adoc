= Using Indexes

== Purpose

* Sequential searches of unordered data can really slow things down
* Imagine looking up a name in a long, unordered list
* We can create metadata for finding the names in that list
* Indexes speed up queries in this fashion

== Pitfalls

* Indexes need to be updated when the table is updated, this can slow
  things down
* Not all data works well with indexes

== Types

=== B-tree

* Default
* Helps with queries using `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>=`, `>`

=== Hash

* Only assists with `=` operator
* Non-unique items require further searching

=== Others

* GiST: An infrastructure for defining how to use indexing strategies
* SP-GiST: more non-balanced, disk-based structures
* GIN: separate entries for components of a relation. Can be useful for arrays.
* BRIN: Block Range INdexes, help find values stored in consecutive physical
  block ranges. 

== What are they good for?

* Can speed up searching queries: `WHERE id=<something>`
* Can speed up ordering results: `ORDER BY`
* You can have a multi-column index
* A multi-column query can still benefit from individual indexes
* Indexes can be created _on expressions_ too:
  `CREATE INDEX test1_lower_col1_idx ON test1 (lower(col1));`

== What's the downside?

* Takes time to build and keep up to date
* In general you should remove indexes that aren't used

== Partial Indexes

* You can get around some downsides with partial indexes
* A partial index is an index with a `WHERE` clause, it just acts on a subset of the data
* This takes up less space
* `CREATE INDEX articles_flagged_created_at_index ON articles(created_at) WHERE flagged IS TRUE;`

== Timing Queries

* You can turn on timing for _all_ queries via `\timing`
* This only gives you times so it may not be the best for benchmarking

== Explaining Queries

* The `EXPLAIN` command will help you benchmark a query
* The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command will do the same but also execute the query and
  time it
