= Relational Database Best Practices

== Backups

* Implement a backup system and practice backup/recovery because a backup isn't
  a backup unless you can recover from it.
* Some popular solutions: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/[mysqldump],
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html[pg_dump]
* Gives you the SQL you need to rebuild the objects in your DB

=== pg_dump

* works one DB at a time
* supports other archive formats
* directory archive
** UNIX directory with individual files for tables
** can be dumped in parallel
** can be selectively restored with pg_restore
* errors on stderr

== Use databases for isolation

* DBMS manage multiple DB and they are typically the first thing admins use to
  seperate objects.
* When you connect you typically specify a DB
* The term database is unfortunately overloaded, especially by users who may
  only ever see _their_ database

=== databases in postgreSQL

[.shrink]
* Every instance of PostgreSQL has at least one DB
* The default DB is `postgres`
* Created with `CREATE DATABASE` and deleted with `DROP DB`
* Can also use `createdb` and `dropdb` from the command line
* `\l` will show you all the DB
* DB are stored in the data_directory (`show data_directory;`)
* Can be stored in different locations via
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/manage-ag-tablespaces.html[tablespaces]

== Use users and limit access

* All modern midsize and above DBMS support multiple users
* Users can be used to limit access to databases and the tables within them
* Users can also be used for accounting to see who is using the DB and how
* Least privilege: Users should be limited to just what they need

=== Users in PostgreSQL

* Users in PostgreSQL are called roles (it could be one person or multiple)
* `CREATE ROLE name;` or `DROP ROLE name;` (command line: createuser/dropuser)
* `\du` lists all of the roles
* roles can have attributes such as a password (
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html[check out
  pg_hba.conf])
* Roles can be altered (ALTER) and granted (GRANT) permissions

== SQL addendum (in case you're rusty)

[.shrink]
* Usually what you need is in more than one table and you will need to join
  them
* This can be explicit, with the JOIN operator, or implicit, multiple tables in
  the FROM clause.
* Either way, make sure you are explicit or you will get a cartesian join (all
  possibilities)
* You can lump rows together with the
  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp[GROUP BY] statement.
* This combined with aggregation operators (COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, AVG) yields
  great summary results.
