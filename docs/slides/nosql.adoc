= The Emergence of NoSQL DBs

== Traditional Development Cycle (Waterfall)

== RDBMS Considerations

* When does the schema get created?
* Who has to make those changes?
* How complex are database migrations?
* How often do they happen?
* How good was your original design?
* RDBMS tend to scale vertically (add more processing power, memory, storage,etc.)
* RDBMS do not shard well (scale horizontally)

[.columns]
=== Sharding

[.col]
* Breaking large tables into smaller chunks (shards) spread across multiple
  servers.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)[Reference]

== CAP-Theorem (Brewer, 2000)

Pick two:

* Consistency: all clients see the same verion of the data (atomic transactions
  can help in achieving this)
* Availability: all clients can always find the requested data
* Partition-tolerance: splitting your system across nodes doesn't affect the
  user

== Key-Value Store

image::key-value.png[]

=== Advantages

* Simple
* Fast
* Great for caches (see https://redis.io/[Redis])

== Wide Column

image::wide-column.png[]

=== Advantages

* Basically a 2D Key-Value
* See https://hbase.apache.org/[HBase]
* Lots of unstructured data across lots of nodes
* Pioneered by
  https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf[Google Big Table]

== Document

image::document.png[]

=== Advantages

* Kind of structured (you can create integrity rules)
* Easy to develop for (you're probably already using a serialization format)
* Easy sharding
* Support https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete[CRUD]
* See https://www.mongodb.com/3[MongoDB]

== Graph

[.shrink]
https://www.infoq.com/articles/graph-nosql-neo4j[Source]

=== Advantages

* Follows the natural flow of getting from one thing to another. Can see significant performance increases on these types of queries.
* Relationships aren't keys, relationships are... well.. relationships
* Shards better than a relational database (think in terms of a map)

== Why go NoSQL?

Are we...

* Solving a problem? - GOOD
* Implementing a solution for a problem that doesn't exist? - BAD (at work)
* Creating a bigger problem? - BAD
