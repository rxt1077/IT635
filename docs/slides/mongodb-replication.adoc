= Replication in MongoDB

== MongoDB Advantages

* Modern database
* High availability from the beginning, not an afterthought
* Failover is built in
* Architecture is consistent
* Popular among developers
* Well documented / widely used (as far as NoSQL DBs go)

== https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/[Replication in MongoDB]

* Replica set - a group of nodes that maintain the same data
* Everyone is NOT equal
* Data bearing nodes and optionally an arbiter node
* ONE data bearing node is the primary which can confirm writes
* Primary node records all transactions to a log (oplog)

== Architecture

== Inter-node Communication

[.shrink]
* Secondaries follow the oplog and perform the transactions to replicate the data
* A heartbeat is maintained to see if the primary becomes unavailable
* If the primary is unavailable an election is held to promote a secondary to primary

== Arbiters

* Arbiters have no data and can resolve ties
* They CANNOT become a primary or a secondary

== Automatic Failover

* If there is no communication with the primary for more the
  electionTimeoutMillis (10 s by default) a secondary calls an election to
  nominate itself as a primary.
* There are NO WRITES processed during an election (remember everything is
  asynchronous), but reads may still occur.
* THIS SHOULD NOT TAKE MORE THAN 12 SECONDS!
