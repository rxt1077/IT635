= Relational Databases

The business workhorse

== The Relational Database Model

* Provides a programmer a logical way to access data (instead of physical)
* Tables are easy to conceptualize
* Structure (schema) and data are independent

== Tables

* A set of entities (rows)
* Each row can be thought of as a tuple
* Columns are attributes of each entity
* Also called a relation or persistent relation

== Table Characteristics

== Keys

[.shrink]
* One or more attributes that determine other attributes
* Primary Key (PK) a key that uniquely (PK integrity) identifies an entity (row)
* Keys allow you to look up things
* Composite key: Composed of more than one attribute
* Key attribute: Any attribute that is part of a key
* Superkey: Any key that uniquely identifies each row
* Candidate key: A superkey without redundancies
* Why might you want a composite key?

== Null values

* Technically an indeterminate state
* Can’t be used on PKs (PK integrity)
* Should be avoided
* Causes linking problems and aggregation problems
* Let’s think of some real-world examples

== Redundancy

* Keys are typically not considered redundant since they allow a particular relational structure to be represented
* Keys can prevent extra attributes from showing up repeatedly

== Example

== Foreign Keys

* An attribute whose values match primary key values in the related table
* Referential integrity: FK contains a value that refers to an existing valid tuple (row) in another relation
* Secondary key: Key used strictly for data retrieval purposes

== Integrity

== Relationships

* 1:M - One to many (FK)
* 1:1 - One to one (May share a PK)
* N:M - Many to many (use another table to map it)

== Indexes

* Solves the problem of looking things up faster
* How do you look things up?
* Prevents having to re-sort the table
* Can have a tree-like structure
* Have to be kept up to date (triggers)

== Codd's Rules

== Common Considerations for an RDBMS

* Price
* Operating System Support
* ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability), Referential Integrity support, Transactions support
* Indexes, materialized view support, trigger support
* Scalability and security
* Availability of support and software

== PostgreSQL

* Powerful, open source _object_-relational database
* Academic roots
* Growing in popularity (take that MySQL!)
* Consistent

[.columns]
== PSQL Meta commands

[.col]
* \q quit
* \c connect to a DB
* \l list DB
* \d describe

[.col]
* \dt describe tables
* \! execute shell command
* \copy copy to file
* \i execute commands from file

== WARNING

Meta commands are dileneated with newlines but SQL statements use semicolons
