= MongoDB Documents, Collections, Databases, and Design

== https://www.json.org/json-en.html[JSON]

[.shrink]
* an lightweight data-interchange format based on how JavaScript represents
  objects
* human readable and _very_ popular:
  `{ "name": "example", "description": "This is an example" }`
* no trailing commas
* no comments
* `\` is used for escape codes: `{ "emoji": "\uF600" }`
* arrays are supported `{ "array": ["one", "two", "three"] }`
* binary representation is called BSON

== https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#bson-document-format[Documents]

[.shrink]
* data records are stored as _documents_ in BSON
* all documents have a `_id` attribute that holds an
  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/#objectid[ObjectId]
* documents can have embedded documents (another document within this document)
* dot notation is used to access array elements by embedded fields:
  "<array>.<index>" or "<document>.<field>"
* documents are also used as
  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#document-query-filter[query filters],
  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#document-update-specification[update specs],
  and https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#document-index-specification[index specs]

=== Example

[source, bson]
----
{
  name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
  contact: { phone: { type: "cell", number: "111-222-3333" } },
  hobbies: [ "code breaking", "running" ]
}
----

* First name: "name.first"
* Second hobby: "hobbies.1"
* Phone number: "contact.phone.number"

== Databases

* DBs hold one or more collections of documents
* `use` switches DBs
* `show dbs` prints a list of all DBs
* the default db is `test`
* MongoDB _will_ create a DB automatically if needed

=== Backing up a DB

[.shrink]
`mongodump` can be used from the command line (not the mongo shell) to export
the content of a running server into .bson files

[source, console]
----
ryan@R90VJ3MK:/tmp$ mongodump --archive="test.bson" --db="test"
2021-03-26T12:30:40.323-0400    writing test.films to archive 'test.bson'
2021-03-26T12:30:40.323-0400    writing test.customers to archive 'test.bson'
2021-03-26T12:30:40.324-0400    writing test.stores to archive 'test.bson'
2021-03-26T12:30:40.344-0400    done dumping test.stores (2 documents)
2021-03-26T12:30:40.347-0400    done dumping test.films (1000 documents)
2021-03-26T12:30:40.356-0400    done dumping test.customers (599 documents)
ryan@R90VJ3MK:/tmp$ ls test.bson
test.bson
ryan@R90VJ3MK:/tmp$ file test.bson
test.bson: data <1>
----
<1> this is _binary_ data, `mongoexport` will give you JSON, but you need to
    run it for each collection

=== Recovering a DB

* `mongorestore` can be used to restore a `mongodump` export
* `mongorestore` _will not_ import objects whose IDs already exist

== Collections

[.shrink]
* documents are stored in collections within a DB
* you can think of collections like tables and documents like the rows
* collections use the dot notation and can be automatically created:
  `db.myNewCollection2.insertOne( { x: 1 } )`
* collections can be shown with `show collections` in the mongo shell
* collections have a UUID which can be seen when you run
  `db.getCollectionInfos()` in the mongo shell

== The Thousand Word Picture

image::mongodb.png[]

== Design: Normalization

* Storing data in multiple collections with references
* Example: a person collection, an address collection, a phone number collection.
* Data is NOT replicated, only in one spot
* Slow reads, fast updates

== Design: Denormalization

* Storing data in a single collection
* Example: a person collection with addresses and telephone numbers
* Data is replicated
* Fast reads, slow updates

== Design: Relationships in MongoDB

* Many more options than an RDMS
* Documents can have documents within themselves
* Documents can reference other documents
* An ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure

== MongoDB is Web Scale!
