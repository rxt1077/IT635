= Exercise 5

In this exercise we will be optimizing a query by creating an index.

== Analyzing the Unoptimized Query

As the `postgres` user, run `psql`, change to the `movies` database, and
describe the `film` table:

[source, text]

You are now connected to database "movies" as user "postgres".

<1> As you can see, our database already has quite a few indexes to optimize
    queries

Now imagine that we are support a web application that picks movies for
customers based on how much time they have. This application will be making
quite a few queries looking for a specific `length` such as
`SELECT title FROM film WHERE length=183`. Let's see how long a query like
this takes by using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:

[source, text]
....
movies=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT title FROM film WHERE length=183;
                                           QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on film  (cost=0.00..67.50 rows=6 width=15) (actual time=0.033..0.211 rows=5 loops=1) <1>
   Filter: (length = 183)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 995
 Planning time: 0.158 ms
 Execution time: 0.220 ms
(5 rows)
....
<1> The total cost of this query is 67.50 with a startup cost of 0.00

As you can see `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` not only prints out the estimated cost, but
_also_ the actual time to perform the query. It also tells you _how_ the query
was performed, `Seq Scan` in this case.

== Creating and Testing A B-Tree Index

Now we'll create a btree index on the `length` column in the `film` table.
Recall that btree is the default so we will not be specifying a `USING`
method:

[source, text]
----
movies=# CREATE INDEX idx_length ON film(length);
CREATE INDEX
movies=# \d film
                                              Table "public.film"
        Column        |           Type           | Collation | Nullable |                Default
----------------------+--------------------------+-----------+----------+---------------------------------------
 film_id              | integer                  |           | not null | nextval('film_film_id_seq'::regclass)
 title                | text                     |           | not null |
 description          | text                     |           |          |
 release_year         | year                     |           |          |
 language_id          | smallint                 |           | not null |
 original_language_id | smallint                 |           |          |
 rental_duration      | smallint                 |           | not null | 3
 rental_rate          | numeric(4,2)             |           | not null | 4.99
 length               | smallint                 |           |          |
 replacement_cost     | numeric(5,2)             |           | not null | 19.99
 rating               | mpaa_rating              |           |          | 'G'::mpaa_rating
 last_update          | timestamp with time zone |           | not null | now()
 special_features     | text[]                   |           |          |
 fulltext             | tsvector                 |           | not null |
Indexes:
    "film_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (film_id)
    "film_fulltext_idx" gist (fulltext)
    "idx_fk_language_id" btree (language_id)
    "idx_fk_original_language_id" btree (original_language_id)
    "idx_length" btree (length) <1>
    "idx_title" btree (title)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "film_language_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (language_id) REFERENCES language(language_id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTR
ICT
    "film_original_language_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (original_language_id) REFERENCES language(language_id) ON UPDATE CASCA
DE ON DELETE RESTRICT
Referenced by:
    TABLE "film_actor" CONSTRAINT "film_actor_film_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(film_id) ON UPDATE CAS
CADE ON DELETE RESTRICT
    TABLE "film_category" CONSTRAINT "film_category_film_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(film_id) ON UPDA
TE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT
    TABLE "inventory" CONSTRAINT "inventory_film_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(film_id) ON UPDATE CASCA
DE ON DELETE RESTRICT
----
<1> You can see here that we now have a btree index named "idx_length" on the
    `length` column.

Now lets test out our query with the same `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command:

[source, text]
....
movies=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT title FROM film WHERE length=183;
                                                    QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on film  (cost=4.32..22.45 rows=6 width=15) (actual time=0.017..0.022 rows=5 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: (length = 183)
   Heap Blocks: exact=5
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_length  (cost=0.00..4.32 rows=6 width=0) (actual time=0.013..0.013 rows=5 loops=1)
         Index Cond: (length = 183)
 Planning time: 0.208 ms
 Execution time: 0.036 ms
(7 rows)
....

You can see that we now have a startup cost of 4.32 but our total cost is down
by a factor of three to 22.45. You'll also see that we are now performing a
`Bitmap Heap Scan` followed by a `Bitmap Index Scan`.

== Creating and Testing A Hash Index

The B-Tree index was a significant improvement, but let's see how a hash index
compares. We'll `DROP` the previous index, create a new `hash` index, and run
our `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` query:

[source, text]
....
movies=# DROP INDEX idx_length; <1>
DROP INDEX
movies=# CREATE INDEX idx_length ON film USING hash (length);
CREATE INDEX
movies=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT title FROM film WHERE length=183;
                                                    QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on film  (cost=4.05..22.18 rows=6 width=15) (actual time=0.017..0.024 rows=5 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: (length = 183)
   Heap Blocks: exact=5
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_length  (cost=0.00..4.04 rows=6 width=0) (actual time=0.011..0.012 rows=5 loops=1)
         Index Cond: (length = 183)
 Planning time: 0.178 ms
 Execution time: 0.048 ms
(7 rows)
....

The results appear to be the same as the B-Tree results. This is because a
`Bitmap Heap Scan` and a `Bitmap Index Scan` still had to be used to find the
result.
